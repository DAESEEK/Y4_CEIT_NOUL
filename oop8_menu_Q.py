#After graduating from college this year, Done landed a job at “Here”,
# a delivery app company. We are trying to create an application 
# where customers who say “come here” can order food for delivery. 
# Younghoon's job is to create a class to represent 
# each delivery food menu in the application.

#Look at the following conditions that the MenuItem class 
# must have and define a MenuItem class that represents 
# a food delivery menu.

class MenuItem:
    # food menu 
    def __init__():
         
         d#add code here
       

    def __str__():
         d# add code here

# menu instance create
burger = MenuItem("Hambuger", 4000)
coke = MenuItem("Coke", 1500)
fries = MenuItem("French fries", 1500)

# menu instance print
print(burger)
print(coke)
print(fries)
